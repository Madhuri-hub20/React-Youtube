What is the role of React in Software development ? 
Ans : allows software developers like to build high-quality user interfaces for web apps.

What is React : 
- React is an open source javascript library
- React is used for building user interface(UI)
- React simplifies the creation of SPA(single page application) by using reusable component.

What is SPA(single Page application)
- A single page application is a web application that have only one single web page
- Whenever user do some action on the website, then in response content is dynamically updated without refreshing or loading new page.

What are the advantages of reacts?
- Simple to build single page application(by using component)
- React is cross-platform and open source(free to use) means we can biuld one platform and we can deploy another platform also
- LightWeight and very fast(bocz it uses virtual dom)
- Large community and ECO system means well documented and many orgnization using reacts and many resources woring react project.
- Testing is easy means testing in react is very easy.

What are the disadvantages of React?
- React is not a good choice for very small application.
eg : small website

What are the difference between React and Angular?

React  :
- React is a javascript library
- React uses a Virtual DOM which makes it faster
- React is smaller in size and lightweight and therefore faster sometime
- React depends on external libraries for many complex features, so developer has to write many lines of code for complex functionlity
- React is simple to learn and more popular than Angular

Angular : 
- Angular is complex framework
- Angular used real DOM
- Angular is bigger because it is complete framework
- Since Angular is a complete framework, therefor it provide built-in support for features like routing, from,validation and HTTP reuests
- Angular is slightly difficult to learn as it has Typescript, OOPs concept and many more things.

What is DOM?
-The DOM(Document Object Model) represent the web page as a tree-like structure which allows javascript to dynamically access and manipulate the content and structure of a web page.

What is the difference betwween DOM and Virtual DOM?
Virtual DOM : 
                -Real DOM is the actual structure of the webpage.
                -React Update complete document in the Real DOM.
                -React uses a Virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI without re-render the entire page, which  help improve performance and make the application more responsive.
DOM : 
        -Virtual DOM is the virtual representation of Real DOM.
        -React update the state changes in Virtual DOM first and then it syncs with Real DOM
        -React DOM is the actual webpage rendered on the browser any changes made directly reflect on the complete webpage.

What are React component?
- In React, component is a reusable building block for creating user interface.
eg. In web page there is so many section we can say like building blocks of this web page like header, menu items ,body ,footer so on .
In react we are creating seperate component for seperate section and this component can be reused aywhere in the website. 

What is NPM? What is the role of node_modules folder?
- NPM(Node Package Manager) : NPM is online repository from where we can get thouusand of free libraries which can be used in our react projects.
- Node_Modules : This folder contains all the dependencies of the project, including the react libraries.

What is the role of public folder in React?
- Public folder contains static assests that are served directly to the user's browser, such as images, fonts and index.html file

What are the role of src folder in react?
- It is used to store all the source code of the application.

What is the role of index.html page in react?
- Index.html file in a React project is the entry point to the application.

What is the role of app.js page in react?
- App.js is the root level component in react application, and it is responsible for rendering all of the other component.

What is the role of funtion and return inside App.js?
- Function is a javascript function that returns a React elements.
eg. function Product(a, b) {
    // Return the product of a and b
    return a * b;
};
console.log(Product(2, 2));

Can we have a function without return inside App.js?
- JavaScript function without a return statement: In JavaScript, using a return statement inside a function is not mandatory
eg. function App(){
    console.log("clicked")
}
export default App;

What is the role of export default inside App.js?
- It is used to make this App component available for import using :import staement in other files.

What is the ReactDOM?
- React DOM is a javascript library which convert your components to atual browser DOM.

What is JSX?
- JSX(JavaScript XML) is a syntaxt extension used by React to write HTML-like code.

What are the advantages of JSX?
Combining Markup & Logic: JSX enables developers to incorporate JavaScript logic and HTML markup in a single file, simplifying the codebase's understanding and maintenance.
Improved TypeScript Integration: JSX and TypeScript work together seamlessly to offer better type-checking and a better development environment.
Enhanced Security: JSX automatically eludes dynamic material to protect users from common security flaws like cross-site scripting (XSS) assaults.

What is the  Babel's ?
- Babel in React, it is Use to translate JSX syntaxt into standard JavaScript which broser can understand.

What is transpiler?
- Transpiler is a tool that converts cource code from one programming language to another.

Difference between Compiler and Transpiler?
Compiler : 
    - It converts a source code written in a high-level language to an output code in a low-level language.
    - The source code has a higher level of abstraction than the output code. 
    - Converting Java code into assembly language instructions is an example of compilation. 
    
Transpiler :
    - It converts a source code written in a high-level language to an output code in a different high-level language.
    - The source code, as well as the output code generated, are of the same level of abstraction. 
    - Converting Java code into C++ code is an example of transpilation.

It is possible to use JSX without React?
- Yes, It's possible to use JSX witjout React by creating your own transpiler like Babel.
- However, this is not recommended since JSX is tightly intergrated with react and relies on many React-specific features.

What is the role of fragment in React?
- In react, a fragment is a way to group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM
eg. function App(){
    retur (
    <>
    <div>Hello</div>
    <div>India</div>
    </>
    );
}

How do you iterate over a list in JSX? What is map() method?
- map() methods allows you to iterate over an array and modify its element using a callback function
eg. 
const arr = [1,2,3,4,5];
const arr2 = arr.map((num) => {
    num = num * 2;
    return num;
})
console.log(arr2);
output : 2 4 6 8 10

What are props in JSX?
- Props(properties) are a way to pass data from a parent omponent to a child component.
eg parent component : 

function App(){
    return(
        <>
        <ChildrenComponent fname="Happy" lname="World" />
        </>
    )
}

children component : 
function ChildrenComponent(props){
    return(
        <>
        <div> 
        {props.fname}, {props.lname};
        </div?
        </>
    )
}
output : Happy World

What is Spread operator ? 
- The spread operator(...) is used to expand or spread an array or Object

eg parent component : 

function App(){
    const props = {fname="Happy" lname="World"};
    return(
        <>
        <ChildrenComponent  {...props} />
        </>
    )
}

children component : 
function ChildrenComponent(props){
    return(
        <>
        <div> 
        {props.fname}, {props.lname};
        </div?
        </>
    )
}
output : Happy World
