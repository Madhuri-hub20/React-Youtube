- React uses a Virtual DOM which makes it faster
- React is smaller in size and lightweight and therefore faster sometime
- React depends on external libraries for many complex features, so developer has to write many lines of code for complex functionlity
- React is simple to learn and more popular than Angular

Angular : 
- Angular is complex framework
- Angular used real DOM
- Angular is bigger because it is complete framework
- Since Angular is a complete framework, therefor it provide built-in support for features like routing, from,validation and HTTP reuests
